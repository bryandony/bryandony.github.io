**I am looking for students of all levels to supervise.** If you are interested in systems research or development and either (a) a current or prospective student at SDSU, or (b) interested in a PhD through UC Irvine ([computational science joint doctoral program](http://catalogue.uci.edu/interdisciplinarystudies/computationalscience_phd/#overviewtext)) or UC San Diego (through the [engineering joint doctoral program](https://www.engineering.sdsu.edu/admissions/jointdocprogram.aspx)), send me an email with your resume and a bit about yourself and your interests. See here for more details.

I am currently an assistant professor in Computer Science at San Diego State University.

Prior to my current appointment I was a researcher at Ericsson in Stockholm with the IoT and cyber-physical systems group, with whom I continue to collaborate. I have been a researcher at the Center for Embedded and Cyber-Physical Systems ([CECS](http://www.cecs.uci.edu/)) with the [Dutt Research Group](https://duttgroup.ics.uci.edu/), and at the chair of integrated systems at the Technical University of Munich.

I received my PhD in Computer Science under the supervision of Professor Nikil Dutt at the School of Informatics and Computer Science, University of California, Irvine. I received my MS and BS in Computer Engineering from the University of California, Santa Barbara. I have spent time as an engineer at National Security Technologies, Oracle, and Google.

My research revolves around self-aware computing systems: I work to enable resource-constrained systems to make intelligent self-management decisions at runtime, typically for high-perforance cyber-physical applications.
