I am currently an assistant professor in Computer Science at San Diego State University.

Prior to my current appointment I was a researcher at Ericsson in Stockholm with the IoT and cyber-physical systems group. I have been a researcher at [CECS](http://www.cecs.uci.edu/) with the [Dutt Research Group](https://duttgroup.ics.uci.edu/), and at the chair of integrated systems at the Technical University of Munich.

I received my PhD in Computer Science under the supervision of Professor Nikil Dutt at the School of Informatics and Computer Science, University of California, Irvine. I received my MS and BS in Computer Engineering from the University of California, Santa Barbara. I have spent time as an engineer at National Security Technologies, Oracle, and Google.

My research revolves around self-aware computing systems: I work to enable resource-constrained systems to make intelligent self-management decisions at runtime, typically for high-performance cyber-physical applications.
